if an element takes the absoulte position it's not considered in the page by the other elements and you have to give him the position otherwise 
the margin can affect it 
position relative make the element move according to itself and it is considered by other elements 
absolute like we mentioned and it moves according to the parent thats position is relative and if there is no parent the parent is the page
sticky reaches a specific position and then remain at its place and you give it the coordinates 
all position types you need to provide coordinates
the default value of position is static which don't move the elements even if you provide coordinates
