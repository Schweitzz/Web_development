it's not a good practice to use an id for styling with css

don't use inline css as you may not have the access to change in the html document or template
also use an external file for the css and it's best to be in a folder as they might be multiple css files

use the kebab-case naming convention for css 
you may use multiple css files because you may use libraries also you may use rtl files for different languages

properties in css has default values

if you want to write multiple propery values in one value like instead of padding top and etc you only write padding you can know it from the browser
padding doesn't allow negative values

auto value for margin doesn't center top or bottom 

you have to specify the three values for the border so it can be displaied type color size

outline is not considered with the element size width or height and don't follow the margin also you can't customize it in the different directoins\

inline displaying have only padding and margin in right and left for padding top and bottom may have an effect but it's not working properly so 
set it to zero 

inline block is the best as you can specify PMWH but still elements will be beside each other

display none is like the hidden attribute of the HTML and a use case is that you can show content when action happen with js as it changes the display value

visibilty hidden differ from them that the element still have its space taken while being hidden unlike the other two

you group classes with commas

for design you can always use max or min width or height etc. also width:fit-content;

overflow is important for design and the best value for it is auto you can also make overflow-x hidden so to prevent scrolling horizontly 
with phone 

you know the direction of the text by the dot at the end

text decoration none is used alot with links to delete the line
as we said it's best to make the style with css not using html attributes but also don't use the text elements with html or don't write 
the text in Uppercase for example just do it with the css

as the link is considered one work it can break the width horizatolly so use word break also the link breaks at special char not includeing
_ or -

/*********************/
for text you can have color shadow align direction vertical align decoration transformation spacing_with_multiple_stuff  indent  word break
overflow and text-overflow
/****************/

you can inherrit from your parent element the properity you specify also by defualt some properties get inherrited and other get overwritten 
by the values of this property given for the element

you have to use a safe web font
you can categorize the fonts into two types with syrif or without and there are fonts for each
items inherit from its nearest parent and idk what is the problem with the p

em is relative to the parent
rem takes from the root element of websites which is the html element

/****************/
for font you have font family style varient weight
if you have italic or bold and you want to retrieve it use font weight normal 
the weigt of the font depends on the type of the font as not all fonts support all fonts 

when you float elements they are no longer calculated or seen from the parent container as they folat so when you overflow hidden they kinda return
to the calculation as hidden cuts them from going out so the conatiner contain them again
there are to ways to solve the float problem clear is hard so just use overflow

###########imp note by default the user agent gives body margin of 8px
you have n elements the no of spaces between them is n-1 and the no of total spaces is n+1
calc is just amazing

opacity works like alpha but for all the content not just the background color
