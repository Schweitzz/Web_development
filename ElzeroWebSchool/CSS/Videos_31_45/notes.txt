z index takes the order of elements meaning if they or all on top of each other the last will appear
z-index doesn't work without the element given a position 
when you consider z-index you consider the order in html as well
z index:-1 takes the last z position
very important note the html order only works if all of them took a position

in CSS classes can be considered as a fn we've seen the clear class now the reset lists class
list-style we have type position img 
shorthand property is the format of the property that combines its subs in one line

remember that table consists of multiple html element you can customize it with them

pseudo means fake 
pseudo classes are alot some of them are general and other for specific elements 
a-> hover visited 
input(type checkbox)->checked
general-> empty ,focus

you can force a state with chrome developer tools so you don't have to simulate the state to see the feedback
Pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of an element or to insert content before or after the content of an element.
so they are fake elements but give us the ability to add some style without the need to add elements for example first letter 
pseudo element is like you have put the first letter of the element in span then you syle it
these are really helpful when you don't have access to the html or the data comes from the database and it's harder with js to select the needed
part and insert the required html element
as classes are like fn in css so pseudo class is a function that happen at specific event

for after and before pseudo elements you have to add content property
look at the arrow trick
