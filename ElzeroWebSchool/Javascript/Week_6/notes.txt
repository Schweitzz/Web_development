This is the array+loops week 6 and 7 
in js you just create the arr even if it's a 3d array it make it without you specifing that
just a string is not considered an array 
you can check if the variable is array by the method isArray
template litteral converts the varibles into string :the array will be converted to a string using its default toString() method, which joins the elements of the array with commas. So, the array will be shown as a comma-separated string.

arrays here are so dynamic

array methods return undefined if the array is empty
strings in js are immutable and cannot be changed once created also the methods deal with the value not the reference kinda like the embedded
where strings are stored in the ro data and from all of this that's why strings are not array
