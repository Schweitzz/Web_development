javascript has the syntactic sugar so you can write more clear number ex 1_000_000 and no problem with interpetion
Number() is a function not casting and it has some macros
what is meant by double presion is that js considers all numbers to be of type double

.toString() and .toFixed return a string and the number is written before them 
parseInt is a function like number but it can extract the number from the words
you can turn a string into a number by Number or parse or +
for instance methods you can use double dots instead of brackets this is only with number to ignore the floating point
you can't chain the Math methods also you can't use it without the class name 

min and max can take multiple arguments 

a variable with given value as string is char array and can be accessed with indexing 
when you try to access an outer element of the array it will give undefined bur methods like .charAt you don't know the behavior but here it 
returns blank which actually can also mean space
you can chain your methods
split returns an array where other methods return a string
