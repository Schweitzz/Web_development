float numbers also has the type number there is no such int or float
its name is array but its type is object
null has the type object 

in javascirpt an html element with a given id is considered an object nested in the window object like the idea of matlab you can use it in the logic
with var you can access the variable before definition but it gives undefined let or const gives and error
var assign any variable declared with it to the window object which can cause scope drama
you can define the variable without var or let as it to be a property of the window object but another variable can be defined with
the same name so this will cause an overwrite

as of css where you can use - or _ at the start or any place of the identifier name you can in js use $ or _

due to the hoisting critiria of var keyword undefined appear when you use it before declaration but just use let it's way better

you can mix between single quotes and double if you want to show one of them 
you can use the escape operator to show a specific char like \" or \\ etc.
\also escape for the new line meaing it make you able to write the code on multiple lines

you can use comman with console.log to write concatenate strings
template literal make you write exactly like you want unlike the console which is like the C in terms of new line and escape sequences and even 
space only exception is the backslash /*but this works only with console but for displaying in the page it doesn't work*/
`  -->backtick
with template literal what you write is what is literally outputted
type of NAN is number NAN is returned when you try to substract a string from a number

+unary opertaor return the number as it is and can cast the string

type correction in js string turns into a number if they put together unless it's a + with a number for ex. 10+"osama" : 10osama
but any thing else with the string will give you NaN 
10-"10" or even "10"-10 will be 0 so don't look at it as it's the unary operator who is doning all the job 
""-2 will be -2 as "" is 0
