remmember the swap trick to convert the sting into an array : arr.split("") and then join("") to turn it into a string again
notice some time it won't recognize a function just because it only accept different datatype

in reduce fn the acc is the first element **in the first iteration** and the current is the second unless intial value is provided
then the acc will be the returned value of each time till you get the last return
unlike the map and filter the reduce fn only return one value not a whole array wether it's the same length as the map or filtered as filter 
***very imp note in reduce or other fn the return only happens once but what is written above is all in the iteration

so the different in forEach is that it loops and make something not bring new array or value
note that when he use this it applies only for the element clicked but when he used ele the loops goes on all
